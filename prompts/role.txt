If you do not know the specific location of the object involved in the task or have no memory of the object after performing previous rounds of tasks, you should use ExploreObject <robot><object> to explore where the object is. If the position information of an object is given, you should use GoToObject <robot><object> to navigate directly to the corresponding object.
