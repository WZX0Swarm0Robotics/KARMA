# **KARMA: Augmenting Embodied AI Agents with Long-and-short Term Memory Systems**

Anonymous EMNLP submission.

Submitted to The 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing(EMNLP).

## Setup

To get started, clone the KARMA repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/WZX0Swarm0Robotics/KARMA
```

Switch to the karma directory
```
cd KARMA
```

Create a conda environment (or virtualenv):
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the virtual environment
```
conda activate karma
```

## Creating OpenAI API Key
The code relies on OpenAI API. Create an API Key at https://platform.openai.com/.

In file /karma/scripts/llm_as_planner.py, change 'your_key' in line 4 of the code to your own OpenAI api key.

In file /karma/scripts/execute_LLM_plan.py, add the following code: api_key = 'your_key'

## Running Script
Run the following command to generate output execuate python scripts to perform the tasks in the given AI2Thor floor plans. 

Refer to https://ai2thor.allenai.org/demo for the layout of various AI2Thor floor plans.

```
python3 scripts/GUI_karma.py 
```
Note: You can enter the tasks you want the agent to perform in the GUI, for exampleï¼š"wash an apple and put it on the countertop", "slice an apple and place it on the plate".
